# Waterlily

A text adventure engine that can run custom text adventure games defined in JSON files.

The goal is to create a game engine which gives game creators large freedom to create text adventures that define their own items, locations, commands and actions without any knowledge of programming.
## Future

A big overhaul of the engine is being made to remove all hard-coding. 
This will affect how items and locations are configured, and add config settings for commands and actions.  
  
This means a new config format (waterlily-2) which will break compatibility with the current format (waterlily-1), and replace it.
