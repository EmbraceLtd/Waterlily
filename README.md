# Waterlily

A text adventure engine that can run custom adventure games defined in .json files.
It features a built-in game called Deerwood and a custom .json file with a game called Testgame to demonstrate customization.

A big overhaul of the engine is being made to remove all hard-coding. 
This will affect how items and locations are configured, and add config settings for commands and actions.
This is done in a separate local branch, which has not yet been pushed.

This will also break compatibility for config files.
